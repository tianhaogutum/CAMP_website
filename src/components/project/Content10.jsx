              Our research aims to extend Bayesian frameworks to better isolate investment skill from luck in private equity, 
              building on prior research to enhance fund selection insights and decision-making within PE firms. We utilize 
              private equity fund performance data and institutional investment data to develop advanced analytical models.

              The study applies Bayesian econometrics and skill vs. luck decomposition techniques to analyze investment 
              dynamics within private equity fund selections. This approach aims to provide more accurate assessments 
              of fund manager capabilities and investment performance attribution.

              This research contributes to the understanding of private equity investment dynamics and suggests potential 
              applications for improving fund selection processes. The Bayesian methodologies could significantly enhance 
              decision-making by providing more nuanced insights into the skill-luck relationship in private markets.
