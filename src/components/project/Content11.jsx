              Our research develops a machine learning framework to improve private equity liquidity modeling 
              by capturing fund-specific patterns and market conditions. We utilize PREQIN private equity fund 
              performance data combined with Bloomberg public markets data to develop advanced forecasting models.
            </p>
            <p>
              The study demonstrates that our machine learning approach outperforms traditional models in 
              accuracy and interpretability, reducing prediction errors by up to 10% and downside risk by 25%. 
              This framework enhances scenario planning and liquidity decisions for better outcomes for Limited Partners.

              This research contributes to the understanding of private equity cash flow dynamics and suggests 
              potential applications for improving liquidity management and investment planning. The machine learning 
              framework could significantly enhance decision-making processes for private equity investors and fund managers.
