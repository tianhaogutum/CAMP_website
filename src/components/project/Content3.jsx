              Our research combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for business description analysis 
              with advanced Bayesian statistical methods. We focus on developing AI-driven approaches to extract 
              insights from textual business data and apply sophisticated statistical modeling.

              The study employs NLP techniques to analyze business descriptions and extract meaningful patterns, 
              while applying Bayesian statistical methods to model uncertainty and make probabilistic inferences. 
              This dual approach allows us to leverage both textual and statistical insights.

              This research contributes to the understanding of business analysis through AI and advanced statistics, 
              suggesting potential applications for improving business intelligence and decision-making processes. 
              The combination of NLP and Bayesian methods could significantly enhance our ability to extract 
              insights from complex business data.
