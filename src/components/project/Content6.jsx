              Our research examines the connectivity and community structure of the European VC network 
              relative to the US and China. Using advanced social network analysis techniques, we analyze 
              co-investment patterns across 238,317 deals involving 26,320 VC firms and 131,720 portfolio companies 
              spanning the period from 2000 to 2022.

              The study reveals that Europe's VC network is more fragmented compared to the US and China, 
              though this fragmentation is improving over time. VC communities are primarily structured around 
              geographic focus rather than sector specialization, highlighting the crucial importance of regional 
              startup ecosystems in fostering investment collaboration.

              This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs seeking 
              to understand and improve the European venture capital landscape. The findings suggest that 
              strengthening regional startup ecosystems and fostering cross-border collaboration could significantly 
              enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of European VC markets.
